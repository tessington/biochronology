# biochronology

Data and code used in Essington et al. "Fitting growth models to otolith increments to reveal time-varying growth".

MCMC outputs - referenced in code as objects in folder "Outputs" are not included because they are too large.  

To run scripts that depend on those, create a subdirectory /Objects, and run the MCMC via R.
